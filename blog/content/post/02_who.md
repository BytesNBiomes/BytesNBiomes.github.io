Roopini and I met in eleventh grade, when She joined my school. I had migrated from remote village to Chennai only two years earlier and was still stuck in [The Town mouse and Country Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Town_Mouse_and_the_Country_Mouse) phase of my life. I don't remember having much friends, or friend like activities and would hardly speak to people, Girls were even more alien to me. So, I usually just get buried in the books that I read.

Roopini was this Girl in my class, who's a strong personality, very cool, boisterous, and unwittingly herself. In every sense, I'd say she was the opposite of me. But, then talking and interacting with her was too unrealistic for me. So I just buried my nose in my books and pretended she didn't exist. Until one day in mid 11th grade, I noticed she was reading a book and talking about it with her friends. It's pretty fascinating how the brain works, almost nothing else would've forced me to such extension to talk with her and borrow the book. I actually thought a lot about the right time to approach and talk because the allure of having someone to share an interest is incredibly high.

After that It actually became a habit for us to exchange books almost regularly. But I wouldn't say I was any less awkward about those interactions. In my mind Roopini was still only a good source of book and that's about it. We never hung out or talked about the books that we've been reading. But, I did put a lot of effort into getting the books that Roopini wanted to read. Which, in retrospect is very interesting. I still remember, I bought Dan Brown's A lost symbol from a used book store only the book was split in the middle. I told Roopini about it and she wanted to read it. But, I just could not imagine giving her a book in 3 pieces. That day I spent the whole evening trying to find a book binder who could stitch it all together, because of which I went home too late in the night and got attacked by my parents.

After 12th grade though, I had to go to a different town for college and Roopini and I lost touch.

We got to chatting in late Freshman year. The obviously weird person that I was, I only had a Nokia 1100 (in 2016 !!) was only available in SMS and didn't use the hip things (back then) like facebook. I used to get Rs. 500 a month to spend on food and everything else.  I used to spend 100 Rs. per month on the SMS pack, even though the only person I text was Roopini. I used to think it was completely worth it.
Later on, We were texting on this chat feature by Youtube. I doubt anyone in the world used that feature as much as we did.
These types of weird communication channels continued for another 3 years until we settled on telegram in 2018, We still continue to use it as our only means of communication. To me, it always was like Communication channel with Roopini had to be devoid of other noise, because I kept her above everyone else. As weird as it sounds, Talking with her in the same channel as others would always feel wrong. 


I like to think that, the thing that got Roopini and I together was a love for all things curious and weird, and being comfortable with ourselves and never giving into peer pressure. We're the type of people who find spending time on theatres boring. We need some activity and creativeness, although I'm a little weak on the activity and creative side of things. Roopini is one of the most passionate and hardworking people I've seen. She used to go to hospital in the middle of the night, travelling 15 Km, just because it gives her patients an additional 0.5% chance of pregnancy because of the timing. I doubt any other person in such person would put such diligence into it. I definitely would not. Despite working 10 hours a day and 6 - 7 days a week. She always used to find time to work on projects, volunteer at forums. I didn't/couldn't do half as much as her despite having a work from home job and had a flexible schedule.

Roopini is the more active and ambitious of the both of us. Although, these days I'm trying to do better.
